# JoyWingVisualizer
A python-based visualizer for the Adafruit JoyWing Feather board and WiFi-Enabled Microcontrollers

The microcontroller, in my case an Adafruit HUZZAH 32 will send the info from the JoyWing board to the visualizer running on your computer using a UDP network connection. 

# Compile / Run
Run the Python script from the visualizer-Folder on you computer. The title bar will show you your IP-address and port.

![A screenshot of the visualizer showing IP-Address and Port in the titlebar](https://github.com/florianheller/JoyWingVisualizer/raw/master/docs/Screenshot.png "Screenshot of the tool")

To run this example you have to set the WiFi credentials and the IP-address of your computer in the Arduino sketch and upload it to your Wifi-enabled Feather board.
